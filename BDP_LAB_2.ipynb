(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i\\'ve only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i\\'ll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\\\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\\\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.

EDT\\n\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \\nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \\nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \\nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \\nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \\npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \\nthose who are here.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \\nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \\ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \\nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \\ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \\nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \\ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \\nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \\nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \\ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \\ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \\nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \\ntake us into the future.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \\nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \\nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \\nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \\nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \\njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \\ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \\nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \\ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \\nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \\nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \\non the right track.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \\nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \\nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \\npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \\nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \\nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \\nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \\nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \\n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \\nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \\nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \\nis learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \\nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \\nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \\nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \\npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \\nhere today.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \\neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \\nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \\nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \\nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \\nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \\njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \\ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \\nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \\npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \\nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \\nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \\nfor them to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \\nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \\nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \\nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \\nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \\nI have proposed to create jobs. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \\nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \\nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \\npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \\ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \\npeople.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But it is especially important for America for two \\nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \\naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \\ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \\neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \\nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \\nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \\nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \\nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \\nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \\norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \\nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \\nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \\ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \\nchance to work.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \\nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \\nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \\nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \\nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \\nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \\nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \\ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \\nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \\nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \\nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \\ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \\nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \\nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \\nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \\nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \\nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \\nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \\nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \\nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \\nsomething there for them to do?\\n\\n\\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \\nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \\nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \\nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \\nsector.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \\nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \\nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \\nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \\nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \\ncreated before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \\nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \\nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \\nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \\na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \\npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \\nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \\njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \\nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \\ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \\neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \\nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \\npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \\nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \\nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \\ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \\nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \\nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \\nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\\n\\t     \\n\\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \\ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \\nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \\n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \\nthe environment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \\nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \\nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \\nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \\njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \\nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \\npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \\nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \\nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \\nhas never fully emphasized before.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \\nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \\ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \\ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \\nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \\nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \\nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \\nyear.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \\nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \\nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \\ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \\nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \\nenvironment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \\nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \\nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \\nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \\nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \\nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \\nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \\nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \\nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \\nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \\nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \\nthey earn, but letting them earn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \\nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \\ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \\nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \\nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \\nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \\nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \\nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \\nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \\nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \\nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \\nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \\nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \\nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \\nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \\nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \\nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \\nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \\nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \\nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \\nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \\nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \\nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \\nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \\nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \\nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \\nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \\ninvestments as well. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \\nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \\nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \\nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \\nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \\nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \\nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \\nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \\nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \\nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \\nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \\nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \\ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \\nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \\nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \\never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \\nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     That does not mean young people should not be \\nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \\nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \\nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \\nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \\npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \\ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \\nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \\njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \\npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \\njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \\nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \\nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \\nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \\nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \\nyoung people want.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \\nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \\npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \\nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \\nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \\nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \\noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \\nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \\neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \\nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \\nkidding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \\ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \\ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \\nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \\ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \\nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \\n(Applause.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \\nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \\ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \\ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \\nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \\neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \\nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \\nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \\nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \\nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \\neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \\nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \\nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \\nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \\nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \\nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \\nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \\npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \\nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \\nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \\nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \\nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \\nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \\nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \\nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n",

The former is used on passports\\n|> etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\\n|> am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\\n|> times and present them at many public places, almost every day.\\n|> These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\\n|> You maintain that this mainly because of religious services\\n|> provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\\'s borders, when Israel was\\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\\'s opportunities for\\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\n|> Ma\\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\n|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'. Such terms have often been\\n|> used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\\n|> Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\\n|> would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\\n|> clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\\n|> very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\\n|> Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\\n|> I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\\n|> discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\\n\\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q\\'s were provocative,\\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\\nthey sought to protect.

In 1743, Thomas \\nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \\nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \\nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \\nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \\nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \\nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \\nsystem.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \\nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \\nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \\nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \\nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \\ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \\nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \\nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \\nalso.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \\nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \\nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \\nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \\nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \\nat this time.  It's great to have you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \\nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \\nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \\nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \\ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \\nfrom school to the work place.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \\nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \\neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \\nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \\nmake things happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \\nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \\nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \\nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \\nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \\nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \\nthe rest of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \\nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \\nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \\nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \\neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \\nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \\nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \\nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \\ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \\nwith changing times.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \\nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \\ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \\nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \\ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \\nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \\nlong run.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \\nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \\nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \\nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \\nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \\nlearn.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \\nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \\nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \\nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \\ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \\nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \\nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \\ncan be learning and working at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \\nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \\ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \\ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \\ncan prepare students for this world of work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \\nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \\nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \\nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \\nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \\njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \\nareas of the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \\nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \\nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \\nwords is that so important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \\nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \\nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \\nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \\ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \\nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \\nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \\nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \\nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \\ntaught before.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \\nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \\nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \\nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \\nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \\ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \\nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \\ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \\ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \\nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \\neducational component of training.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \\nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \\nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \\neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \\nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \\ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \\nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \\napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \\nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \\neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \\nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \\nyoung people even beyond the summer.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \\nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \\nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \\ndeveloping.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \\nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \\nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \\nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \\nget in a high school diploma.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \\nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \\neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \\npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \\ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \\nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \\nemployers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \\ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \\nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \\ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \\nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \\nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \\nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \\nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \\na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \\nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \\nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \\nthe earnings of American workers.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \\nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \\npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \\neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \\nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \\nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \\npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \\ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \\nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \\nalready out there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \\nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \\ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \\nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \\nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \\nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \\nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \\ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \\ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \\nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \\nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \\naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \\nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \\nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \\ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \\none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \\nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \\ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \\nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \\nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \\nstrategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \\nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \\nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \\ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \\nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \\neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \\ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \\ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \\nskills for on-the-job learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \\nalready being done.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \\npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \\ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \\nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \\nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \\nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \\ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \\nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \\ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \\nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \\nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \\nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \\nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \\ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \\ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \\nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \\nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \\nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \\ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \\ncoming forth before too long.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \\nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \\nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \\na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \\nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \\nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \\ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \\nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \\ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \\nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \\ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \\nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \\ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \\nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \\nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \\ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \\nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \\nlife-long learning in this country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \\nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \\nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \\nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \\nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \\nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \\nthat we need to meet.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \\nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \\nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \\nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \\npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \\nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \\nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \\nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \\nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \\nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \\ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \\nI wonder if you would comment on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \\nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \\ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \\nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \\nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \\nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \\nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \\nfor jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \\ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \\ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \\ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \\nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \\ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \\nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \\nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \\nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \\ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \\nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \\nTodd of Austin, Texas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \\nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \\nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \\nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \\nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \\nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \\nvery supportive.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \\nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \\nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \\nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \\nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \\nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \\nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \\nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \\nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \\nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \\nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \\nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \\nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \\nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \\nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \\nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \\nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \\nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \\ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \\nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \\nworking on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \\nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \\nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \\ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \\nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \\nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \\nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \\ntrained on a year-round basis.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \\na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \\nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \\nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \\nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \\nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \\nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \\ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \\nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \\nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \\nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \\nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \\nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \\naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \\njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \\nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \\neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \\nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \\nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \\nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \\ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \\nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \\nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \\nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \\nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \\nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \\ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \\nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \\nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \\nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \\nmoving.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Doctor?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \\nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \\nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \\nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \\nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \\nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \\nextremely effective learning strategy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \\nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \\nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \\npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \\nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \\nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \\nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \\ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \\nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \\ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \\ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \\nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \\nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \\nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \\nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \\nthem and we can discuss it later.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \\nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \\nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \\npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \\nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \\nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \\nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \\nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \\nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \\nvocational program.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \\nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \\nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \\nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \\nstudents that needs them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \\nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \\nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \\n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \\nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \\nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \\ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \\ncareer directions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \\ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \\ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \\nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \\nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \\nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \\n\\n                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n",

EDT\\n\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, \\ntwo months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our \\nnational deficit and to increase our investment in the American \\npeople, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget \\nplan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope \\nand opportunity in the country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, \\nwhich would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed \\nthe House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support \\nof a majority of the United States Senate. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get \\nthe economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a \\nfast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  \\nUnfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate \\nhave used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working \\nthe will of the majority on the jobs bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every \\nstate and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue \\nis not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking \\nfor full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't \\ncare about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying \\nthe rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the \\ntable and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of \\ndignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their \\nfamilies and drawing a paycheck.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of \\nserving to put aside politics and do something now to move our \\neconomy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working \\nwith the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some \\nof the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs \\nplan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on \\njobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet \\nnational needs.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  \\nToday I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what \\nsize package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of \\nthe American people. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But even as we make those reductions and the package \\nwill be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the \\nminds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is \\nthe need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the \\ndramatic rise in violent crime. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an \\nadditional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities \\nto rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the \\nfiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a \\nmatching effort by local governments, this could put as many as \\n10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in \\ncommunities all across our nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of \\nviolent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many \\npeople have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their \\nhomes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments \\nAmerica can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that \\ninvestment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep \\nthe economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no \\nmistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I \\never have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight \\nfor their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to thank the police officers who are here today \\nand tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here \\nthat I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to \\nrehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the \\nsummer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to \\ntalk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement \\nconcern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country \\nto have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and \\na brighter and more peaceful future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I say what I say today not just because it's good for \\nlaw enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in \\nthese communities.  I have always supported community policing not \\nonly because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, \\nbut because it cements better relationships between people in law \\nenforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces \\nthe chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the \\nchances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  \\nI promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put \\nanother 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four \\nyears.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind \\nthe core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the \\njobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if \\nyou will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept \\nthe fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to \\nbuilding our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will \\ncreate real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my \\npart now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want now to give the people who are here with me on \\nthe platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the \\nAmerican people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished \\nAttorney General.\\n  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that \\nthe jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over \\nthe suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional \\ndialogue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --\\nthey wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, \\nI made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's \\na lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- \\npeople have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden \\nof the present system on many of our major employers, particularly \\nmany of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the \\nstrength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision \\nthat would even approach that on that or any other kind of general \\ntax.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you personally believe that the American public \\nis ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I \\nmean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I \\nwill say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the \\nbenefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --\\neveryone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you \\nstreamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that \\nthere's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or \\nover-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive \\ncare in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows \\nabsolutely massive savings to the health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The real question is whether you can transfer those \\nsavings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have \\nvirtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I \\nhave no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is \\nthe polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, \\nthey say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an \\naffordable health care system.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I don't think that has anything to do with this \\nstimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first \\nand foremost.  They want that more than anything else.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Now that you've announced your willingness to \\ncompromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of \\nyour package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer \\njobs is one.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the \\nhighway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let \\nme say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime \\nbill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a \\nsupplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think \\nwe need to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the \\nenormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately \\nand disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people \\nwith AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be \\ndone.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the \\nsafety of the public depends on that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I \\ndon't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator \\nMitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole \\ncalled me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call \\nhim back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we \\ndiscussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said \\nthat I would not make any statements about any specifics until at \\nleast they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could \\nreach some accord.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been \\nalready, and let's see if they can talk it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator \\nMitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 \\nmillion, that you want that as part of the package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word \\nfor Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator \\nDole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  \\nBut I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I \\nwanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a \\nreformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even \\nmore focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the \\nAmerican people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly \\nconsistent with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\\n\\n                                 END3:12 P.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n"
